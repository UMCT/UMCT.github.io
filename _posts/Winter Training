Winter Training on the bike will begin in St. Paul in late November. 

Until then, there is weekly Monday night stregnth training in the Rec at 8 pm led by Coach Addison. As well, there are social rides to Theo on Wednesday leaving from Goldy at 5 and the "Long Ride" led by Anton on Sunday mornings. 
Additional group rides will sent in the emails on a weekly basis when the weather allows. 

An email will sent out with the starting date of the indoor training and the upcoming power test.

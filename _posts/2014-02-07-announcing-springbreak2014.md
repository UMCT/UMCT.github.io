The 2019 Spring Break location is still being decided. A recap of the 2018 Spring Break trip gives a better look at what Spring Break Training Camp will unfold. 

Last season the UMCT team rolled out to Boulder, Colorado for long miles, long climbs and high elevation. The average day at the training camp included an morning skills clinic, an afternoon ride and an evening adventure in Boulder. After racking in the miles and elevation the team travelled north to Fort Collins, Colorado and raced against Colorado teams. 


We will be posting updates throughout the trip here on UMCT.org as well as on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/UofMCycling) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uofmcycling).

title: About UMCT
---
The University of Minnesota Cycling Team is the Twin Cities campus' competitive and recreational cycling group. We strive to encourage cycling at the University as well as to develop skilled and strong riders and racers through our training and racing activities.

On the recreational front, we have frequent group rides during the warmer months. Watch our Facebook page for any ride postings.

We are a USA Cycling licensed collegiate racing team in the [North Central Collegiate Cycling Conference](http://collegiatecycling.org/ncccc/), which we have won at the team level for 16 years running!

### Disciplines
We have riders who participate in most major disciplines, particularly road, track, cyclocross, and mountain. The majority of our membership and our season is currently road-oriented, though we hope to change that in the coming years.

### Membership
Our team group rides are open to any person who has filled out a Sport Clubs Participation Waiver. Further benefits are available to dues paying members in the following tiers:

* **Club Membership ($60):** access to winter training sessions, power testing, discounted clothing, and access to team pro-deal purchases.
